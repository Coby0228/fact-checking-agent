This consensus indicates that while there are elements of truth in the claim, it requires a deeper understanding of the context surrounding Harris's evolving perspective on police presence and community safety. The majority viewpoint across all Fact Checkers emphasizes that the claim correctly identifies a shift in Harris's statements that could be perceived as contradictory. However, a critical aspect noted by all three is that these do not represent outright contradictions without context. Instead, they point to a nuanced evolution in her views, reflecting a response to changing understandings of effective policing and community safety. The provided evidence suggests that Harris moved from advocating for an increase in police presence to emphasizing a critique of conventional policing approaches, advocating for broader community investment instead. This adaptation showcases her reassessment of the relationship between police presence and public safety rather than a straightforward contradiction. While the claim highlights the apparent discrepancies in her statements, it fails to appreciate the complexity and context of her transformation in thought. Each Fact Checker underlined that her position is dynamic and responsive to evolving discussions on policing strategies, indicating that while her earlier assertions may seem inconsistent with her current stance, this is part of a larger narrative of growth rather than a direct contradiction. In conclusion, the final determination of 'half-true' reflects the fact that while the claim captures the essence of her changing perspective, it lacks the necessary context to fully assert that her statements are simply contradictory.",

All three fact checkers agree that while the video does show a robot displaying malfunctioning behavior, it does not support the notion that the robot is armed or intentionally targeting humans. This consensus emphasizes that the robot's behavior can be attributed to a malfunction rather than a purposeful act of aggression. Each of the fact checkers pointed out the absence of evidence indicating that the robot is armed. Furthermore, they all noted the implications of intentionality in the claim are misrepresentations of the actual circumstances, where the robot’s erratic behavior can likely be explained by technical failures instead of malicious intent.
