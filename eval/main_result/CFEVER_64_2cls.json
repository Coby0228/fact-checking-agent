Their assessments provide a clear understanding of the term 'Molly' and its contextual associations. The majority opinion emphasizes that while 'Molly' has historical connections to homosexual men, it does not specifically refer to male sex workers who serve gay men. The term encompasses a wider spectrum of LGBTQ+ identities rather than being limited to a specific subset of sex work. The consistent emphasis from both fact checkers on the broader connotations and the absence of evidence linking 'Molly' to sex work supports this conclusion.",

The connections made between early cases and the Huanan Seafood Market align with broader scientific consensus regarding the early epidemiological characteristics of the virus. Subsequent actions taken by Chinese health authorities and the eventual declarations by the WHO underscore a timeline that corroborates the claim of the virus becoming a major epidemic that spread across Asia and eventually worldwide.",

Both fact checkers stressed that there is no verification of either the population density or the classification of Miliyana as a town, which are crucial elements of the claim. The lack of credible sources or data to back the claim further supports the decision to deem it false.",

While there were activities related to the school in 1920, the official establishment under the current name occurred later, in 1941.
