            "justification": "The collective predictions from the two Fact Checkers both arrived at a consensus that the claim regarding Cornell University is true. Upon examining the details presented in the claim, it accurately states that Cornell University was established after the American Revolutionary War, is located in New York, operates as a private university, is a member of the Ivy League, and has multiple campuses.
